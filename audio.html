                <h2>Top 5 Wireless earbuds - 2023</h2>
                <p>The best true wireless earbuds are packed with high-end features and advanced audio tech. The good news is you no longer need to sacrifice decent battery life, quality sound and excellent active noise cancellation (ANC) to cut the cord.

                    The top true wireless earbuds are entirely wire-free. This means no wire connects your devices to your buds, and nothing connects one bud to another. Many prefer this style because it’s the most comfortable and convenient. Although we’re also told it makes losing the buds easier, you’ve been warned.</p>

                <h4>1. Sony WF-1000XM4 Wireless Earbuds</h4>
                <h5>The best true wireless earbuds overall</h5>
                <p>
                    Sony has created fantastic audio tech over the years and is one of the best brands around for making true wireless earbuds. We found the WF-1000XM4s a joy to review, and with them the company has combined performance, ergonomics, and build quality more effectively than ever before. Compared to their predecessors, the Sony WF-1000XM3 earbuds, we found that the newer wireless earbuds offer enough quality-of-life features to make them worth upgrading to, even if they are more expensive.
                    A more compact design means that the WF-1000XM4 buds are more comfortable than the XM3s, we found the fit to be great during our testing and suitable for all-day wear. Their accompanying control app makes it easy to adjust the EQ settings of the buds, which means you get a more personalized sound and can tweak frequencies to suit your preferences.

We'd rate the audio quality as among the best you'll get from a pair of true wireless in-ear headphones, and DSEE Extreme upscaling essentially means you'll get an approximation of high-resolution sound from standard-definition digital audio files.

We do think that some other true wireless earbuds surpass the Sony WF-1000XM4 in specific areas – the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2 in the list below offer better noise cancellation, for example – but no other model comes close to offering such excellent quality across the board. That’s why the Sony WF-1000XM4 are hands-down the best true wireless earbuds you can buy today.

                <h4>2. Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 Plus</h4>
                <h5>The best budget wireless earbuds</h5>
                <p>
                    Cambridge Audio may be best known for its high-end audio equipment, but in recent years the British company has branched out into the world of true wireless earbuds. Its first offering, the Melomania 1, earned a place among the best wireless earbuds thanks to their stellar sound quality. And the newer Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 Plus are better still, putting many other earbuds in the shade with their audio performance, battery life, and ease of use. 

The design of the Melomania 1 Plus hasn’t deviated too far from its predecessors, but during our testing we found that there’s a clear step up in terms of audio performance here. The levels of detail and clarity rival some of the best over-ear headphones you can buy. Add to that, there's a helpful accompanying app, easy controls, and excellent connectivity, which made us love them even more. 

The only real downside we found was the lack of active noise cancellation on offer – but when you experience the sound quality here we don't think many people will mind, not least because a permanent price cut means these are even more affordable than before. They cost $139.95 / £119.95 at launch, but the audiophile-friendly earbuds have now been reduced to $99.95 / £99.95 – a fixed discount of $40 / £20.

If the lack of noise cancellation is a dealbreaker for you, take a look at the Earfun Air Pro 3 buds further down in the guide. They're not as cheap as the Melomania 1 Plus but do drown out the world when you want to focus.

                <h4>3. Apple AirPods Pro 2</h4>
                <h5>Best for Apple phone owners</h5>
                <p>
                    Apple's latest buds pack excellent audio performance and upgraded ANC into a compact and comfy true wireless form factor. 

                    The original Apple AirPods Pro are among our choice of the best true wireless earbuds, especially if you have an iPhone, allowing you to take full advantage of the Apple-centric features. But the Pro 2 are a significant step up, offering improved audio performance that's rich and expansive – thanks to new drivers and amplifiers – as well as better ANC, which we found to be extremely impressive during our testing. 
                    
                    As with many true wireless earbuds, there's a transparency mode aboard both models of the AirPods Pro, but this newer version offers adaptive transparency, which makes for more natural and easy conversations when you don't want to remove your buds. Battery life is boosted to 6 hours with an impressive 30 hours from the charging case, which has had its own set of upgrades including IPX4 water resistance for light showers and sweat. 
                    
                    As always with Apple products, the AirPods Pro 2 are best suited to those with an iPhone and a big budget. But if that's you, these are some of the most impressive true wireless earbuds you can buy today, rivalling not only the original Pro buds but also providing a listening experience on par with many of our long-standing favorites, including the Sony WF-1000XM4 Wireless Earbuds.

                <h4>4. JLab Go Air Pop</h4>
                <h5>The best ultra-cheap true wireless earbuds</h5>
                <p>
                    These are not the best true wireless earbuds – not by far. But they're one of the best pairs if you're on a tight budget as they're incredibly cheap (under $20 / £20) and, for that price, excellent value for money. 

                    When we tested the JLab Go Air Pop buds, we found the sound to be incredibly impressive considering the price tag. What's more, the battery life is better than anything Apple's currently offering – as well as many other rivals in this list – and their lightweight construction means we found them comfortable to wear for long periods, too. 

                    there are some surprising features included here too, like on-earbud controls and built-in mics that we think are decent enough for making phone and video calls. 

                    The downside is the codecs: these use SBC, the least good kind of Bluetooth audio; there's no support for aptX, LDAC or the like. However, they're perfectly good for audiobooks and podcasts, and while they might not be as clearly musical as their more expensive rivals they're not bad either.

                <h4>5. Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2</h4>
                <h5>The best true wireless earbuds for noise cancelling power</h5>
                <p>
                    The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2 are probably the best true wireless earbuds you can buy today if we were ranking them on noise-cancelling capabilities alone. They're an upgrade of the original Bose QuietComfort buds and this redesign has improved the noise cancellation considerably, which is really saying something considering the originals were already great. But this isn't at the expense of sound quality. In our review, we wrote: "We can’t stress this enough – the sound is very well balanced, with a heck of a lot of details and textures coming through. And if you still find you need to tweak it, you can via the EQ in the app."
                    But although ANC and sound is great here, they don't take one of the top spots in our list because, as far as true wireless earbuds go, some specs are lacking. For example, battery life is only fine at 6 hours from the buds and a further 3 from the case. There's no support for high-def wireless codecs, which for the steep price is disappointing.

                    However, if you can afford to splurge and want immersive sound and noise-cancellation above all else, these are an excellent choice.
