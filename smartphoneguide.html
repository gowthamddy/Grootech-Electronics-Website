                <h2>Smartphone buying guide</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Have your eye on a new phone from Apple, Samsung, or another manufacturer? These days, it’s not hard to find smartphones with big gorgeous screens, an assortment of cameras, and long battery life. Premium phones can easily cost more than $1,000, but less expensive models still perform extremely well, and CR recommends plenty of phones that cost under $600. It all depends on which features really matter to you.
                    <br>
                    Steep discounts are often available from cell phone service providers—you just need to make sure you understand the terms. If you get a high-end phone for just a few hundred dollars from a carrier, you’ll need to stick with that company until the phone is paid off, or you may owe the balance on the original, full price.
                    <br>
                    Here’s a guide to help you sort through the options.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <h2>Do You Need a New Phone?</h2>
                <p>
                    Here are four cases where it might be wise to replace an old phone.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Your Phone’s Performance Is Lagging:</strong>
                    <br>
                    You can replace a cracked display or an anemic battery, but when system improvements from Apple or Google reduce the performance of your phone, it’s probably time to replace it. You might notice sluggish response times and frequent crashes.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Your Phone No Longer Receives Security Updates:</strong>
                    <br>
                    In addition to major operating system (OS) upgrades, manufacturers promise you scheduled security updates for your new phone—up to a point. Apple provides them for models dating back to the iPhone 5s released in 2013. By contrast, Samsung offers up to five years of updates for most recent Galaxy phones. Google does the same for models released since the Pixel 6, but Pixel 4 series phones are supported for just three years. The OS and security update policies for other Android phone manufacturers often vary by device. The point is if your phone is so old that it’s no longer receiving security updates, it’s time to say goodbye.
                    <br>
                    <strong>You’re Moving to a New Cell Phone Provider:</strong>
                    <br>
                    Years ago, switching carriers meant you automatically got a new phone. Providers locked the models they sold onto their networks to keep you loyal. But that’s no longer true. Apple and Samsung now sell unlocked phones with the technology to operate on various networks. And, by law, carriers are required to unlock your phone for free once you’ve paid off the device. So you don’t have to get a new phone if you’re switching providers. But it often makes sense. You can trade in an old phone to offset the cost of a new one or even receive a replacement at no extra cost.
                    <br>
                    <strong>You Want a Top-Notch Phone Camera and Display:</strong>
                    <br>
                    These days, annual improvements in handset technology are less significant than they were a few years ago, so there’s less incentive to upgrade. For instance, the iPhone 12 is still recommended by Consumer Reports, even though it was introduced years ago. Ditto for the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G, which came out at the beginning of 2021. Phone cameras and displays have been excellent in many smartphones for several generations now.
                    <br>
                    However, some things are changing. More phones have multiple cameras now, for better wide-angle, zoom, or macro photography. And screens are continuing to improve, too. More phones now have OLED screens, with vibrant colors and great contrast. Only you can say whether the incremental improvements are enough to make you want to upgrade.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Picking Your Phone Operating System</h2>
                <p>Smartphones all share the ability to browse the web and run apps, handle office and personal email, and facilitate social networking. Both operating systems shown here offer a vast array of mobile apps.
                    <br>
                    And although most people tend to stick to the same OS, it’s worth knowing all the facts. A switch could bring you additional features or a way of interacting with your stuff that’s more appealing than what you have now.
                    <br>

                    <strong>Android</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you want a wide choice of phones, you’ve come to the right OS. Google’s Android platform supports myriad models from Google, OnePlus, Samsung, and others. Options include everything from compact models to phones with displays larger than 6 inches.
                    <br>
                    he Android OS is highly customizable, thanks to widgets and other tools for tweaking phone controls, as well as the desktop’s overall look and feel. Android’s native Google search engine, Gmail, Maps app, and cloud-based Drive and Photos services are among the most widely used smartphone apps (even among iPhone users).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The major drawback to Android is that many phones are sold with older versions of the OS, and users don’t always get updates in a timely way. And the companies that make the phones tend to layer their own software on top of the OS, which can eat up storage space and clutter your home screen.
                    <br>
                    <img src="sg2.jpeg">

                    <br>
                    Apple’s iOS interface is the same from carrier to carrier and almost identical to the OS on the iPad. Apple also makes its iPhones interact easily with MacBooks, the Apple Watch, and other Apple devices, such as the AirPods Pro headphones.
                    <br>
                    The Siri voice-controlled assistant is quite adept at interpreting and executing an impressive number of requests. Recent versions of iOS brought peer-to-peer payments to Apple Pay, along with new augmented-reality capabilities.

                    <h2>Phone Features to Know About</h2>
                    In addition to making calls and giving you web access, today’s smartphones are loaded with features to help you be more creative, productive, and efficient.

                    <h4>Biometrics</h4>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Biometrics use unique physical characteristics—fingerprints, facial recognition, voices—to identify people. The characteristics are recognized by a sensor and converted into digital form. After the scanner registers your print, for instance, you can use your finger as a “password.” Increasingly, phones use facial recognition.

                    <br>
                    <h4>camera</h4>
                    Though smartphone cameras are still not as good as their stand-alone counterparts, they’ve come a long way. Many phones have multicamera setups that include wide, ultrawide, and telephoto options. Portrait and Night modes often come standard. And even the most basic phones now have onboard apps that can improve unflattering shots—even after you’ve taken the picture.

                    <br>
                    <h4>Wireless Charging</h4>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    No more fumbling with adapters and their sometimes tricky jacks. Just lay the phone down on a special mat or dock, and voilà! It begins to charge.
                    <br>
                    But just a heads-up. Some phones and chargers are faster than others. And while the vast majority of phones that do wireless charging work with Qi chargers, only certain ones are quick-charge compatible. Bottom line: Before you buy a phone or a charger, make sure your choices work well together.
