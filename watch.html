                <p>Today's smartwatches can also measure your heart rate, detect elevations, and automatically connect you to emergency services if you have a fall. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood oxygen (SpO2) readings are perks of certain models, too. 

                    That said, the best smartwatches go above and beyond, housing various features and apps while keeping up with your day-to-day needs. And of course, there's style: many smartwatches can be customized, from their straps to their faces, to fit your personality.

                <h4>1. Apple Watch Series 8</h4>
                <h5>The best smartwatch overall</h5>
                <p>The Apple Watch 8 is the best Apple Watch yet. It’s not a major upgrade over the Apple Watch Series 7 in terms of features, but it has the same great design and larger screen. What's new between the Apple Watch Series 8 vs. Series 7 is the skin temperature sensor, which can inform cycle and fertility tracking, as well as sleep tracking. The Series 8 also launched with the long-awaited low power mode, which can extend the latest Apple Watch's battery life to 36 hours. What's more, the Apple Watch 8 has a new crash detection feature, leveraging improved motion sensors for instant help when you might need it most.
                    Otherwise, the Apple Watch Series 8 is a full-featured health tracker and communications tool. With watchOS 9, this smartwatch packs the latest and greatest of what the Apple Watch experience has to offer. Whether you want a smartwatch for working out, answering calls from your wrist, or using the best Apple Watch apps, this is the best smartwatch for you. As long as you have an iPhone, of course.

                <h4>2. Samsung Galaxy Watch 5</h4>
                <h5>The best smartwatch for Android</h5>
                <p>
                    The Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 has a new skin-temperature reader, more scratch-resistant display and a longer-lasting battery life. It's the best Samsung watch yet, because while there aren't a ton of differences between the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 vs. Galaxy Watch 4, the changes make what was already a great device all that much better. And starting at $279, it remains a fair value. 


Though the skin temperature reader won't work at launch, there's plenty to like about the Galaxy Watch 5. For one, it lasted for an entire two days in our testing, and reached almost 50% charge from 0% in 30 minutes. Wear OS 3 with Samsung's skin has more perks, too, including Google Assistant and better interoperability with your other Samsung devices. For more GPS features and an even longer-lasting battery life,

                <h4>3. Google Pixel Watch</h4>
                <h5>The best smartwatch for Pixel smartphones</h5>
                <p>
                    The Google Pixel Watch is the best smartwatch for Pixel phone users, bar none. Though it’s a first-generation device, a clean design, a full collection of Google apps and fitness tracking powered by Fitbit’s platform make for a compelling smartwatch. In many ways, the Pixel Watch is the best of both worlds, pairing a top-notch Wear OS experience with Fitbit’s holistic health-tracking (which is further enhanced with a Fitbit Premium membership.) There are plenty of tools on-board for staying connected and getting active.

But there’s some room for improvement: the thick bezels and singular size option might deter some users in terms of design, while we found the battery life feels disappointing compared to that of other Fitbit smartwatches. Still, the Pixel Watch stands out enough from other smartwatches for Android, making for what we consider a successful first attempt based on our testing.

                <h4>4. Apple Watch SE (2022)</h4>
                <h5>The best smartwatch value for iPhone users</h5>
                <p>
                    The Apple Watch SE is kind of a hybrid device, pairing an older Apple Watch design with the Apple Watch Series 8's chipset. The $249 smartwatch doesn't have all the Series 8's features, but still stands out for its great fitness tracking and safety features. It also offers an LTE option, making it a good choice for those interested in trying out Family Setup.

                    When choosing between the Apple Watch Series 8 vs. Apple Watch SE (2022), your ultimate decision will be if you want to spend an extra $150 for a brighter display with an always-on option, an ECG monitor and skin-temperature, and a bigger display. If those tools aren't deal-breakers for you, the SE is a highly capable option for iPhone users. It even gets watchOS 9, the most up-to-date Apple Watch software with low power mode, fresh new watch faces, an upgraded workout interface, a redesigned compass tool and the new Medications ap

                <h4>5. Fitbit Sense 2</h4>
                <h5>The best smartwatch from Fitbit</h5>
                <p>
                    Compared to the original Fitbit Sense, the Sense 2 features an upgraded design, interface and EDA sensor, making for Fitbit's most holistic smartwatch yet. Thanks to advanced health analysis and deep integration with Fitbit Premium, the $299 Sense 2 also sustains an edge in fitness-tracking over many of the best smartwatches  on this list.

                    An update to the stress-detecting EDA (electrodermal activity) sensor plays a large role in the device’s success: now called cEDA ('c' for continuous,) the sensor monitors stress levels or heightened responses throughout the day, prompting the user to take action on mood monitoring with Body Response notifications. However, added support for Google Wallet and Google Maps, while useful upgrades, won’t be available for the Fitbit Sense 2 at launch. There’s oddly no third-party app support, either. Still, for a smartwatch that helps you get in touch with how you feel, the Sense 2 succeeds.

                <h4>6. Garmin Venu 2 Plus</h4>
                <h5>The best fitness-tracking smartwatch</h5>
                <p>
                    The Garmin Venu 2 was already a stellar fitness-tracking smartwatch. We consider it one of the best Garmin watches that’s both a capable workout companion and stylish lifestyle device. The $449 Garmin Venu 2 Plus introduces on-wrist calls and voice assistants. While it maintains Garmin’s reputation for thorough fitness tracking and accurate GPS, the Venu 2 Plus is now a stronger sell for those who want their smartwatch to act as an extension of their smartphone.
                    hough Garmin still lacks a large third-party app store and continues to steer clear of LTE support, embracing more communication tools is a major step towards mastering the complete smartwatch experience. 10 days of battery life is the cherry on top.

                <h4>8. Fitbit Versa 4</h4>
                <h5>The best smartwatch for step counting</h5>
                <p>
                    The Fitbit Versa 4 is the best smartwatch for step tracking based on our testing. We will say it's not the best smartwatch for fitness tracking overall, as it struggles to provide accurate heart rate readings. But if you're looking for something that will get you moving with hourly step reminders and alerts when you've reached your daily goal, this smartwatch is a great choice.
                    Not only that, the Versa 4 a lovely-looking smartwatch with a slim profile and sleek metallic finishes. It looks very similar to the Fitbit Sense 2, yes, but this is the better choice if you're on a tighter budget or aren't as interested in stress-tracking. The Versa 4 still has reliable sleep-tracking and other perks available via Fitbit Premium.
